ðŸŽ¨ Etch-a-Sketch Grid (Flexbox + JavaScript)

This project creates an interactive pixel-style sketch pad using HTML, CSS (Flexbox), and JavaScript.
Hover over the grid to "draw" with your mouse, and use the button to reset or resize the grid dynamically!

ðŸ§  Project Overview

This project builds a 16x16 grid of square divs dynamically using JavaScript (not hardcoded in HTML).
It uses Flexbox to align the squares neatly into rows and columns.

When you hover over a square, its background color changes â€” leaving a pixelated trail, just like an etch-a-sketch.

ðŸš€ Features

âœ… Creates a 16x16 grid automatically using JavaScript.

âœ… Uses Flexbox for grid layout (no CSS Grid used).

âœ… Adds a hover effect to color squares when your mouse passes over them.

âœ… Includes a Reset Grid button that:

Prompts the user for a new grid size (up to 100x100).

Clears the previous grid.

Creates a new grid with the same total container size.

âœ… Keeps total grid size fixed (e.g., 960px width), adjusting square sizes automatically.

ðŸ§© Extra Credit:

Randomized RGB color on hover.

Progressive darkening effect â€” each hover darkens the color by 10% until the square is completely dark.
